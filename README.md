Challenege 3: Morse Code with Radio 

We have got 2 files. One of the file contains a main.cpp file which sends the dot and dashes. 
We have got a folder called recieve which contains a header file and a cpp file. 
The header file contains the mapping for the morse code. The cpp file recieves the dot and dashes and translate them into a letter according to the mapping.

We have two hex file and we have a reciever and a sender. 
Firstly the sender need to press button A to send dot and dashes. If you hold the button less than 500 then it will send a dot and more than 600 will send a dash.
As you press the button A, the microbit will communicate with each other and send the dot and dashes immediately.

once all the character is recieved then you need to press button B on the other microbit in order to see the actual letter.
